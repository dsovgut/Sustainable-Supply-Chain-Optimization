    "**Process and Assumptions for Calculating Costs and Emissions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demand Distribution**:\n",
    "   - The demand for both BSC and CFP items was distributed across five regions:\n",
    "     - **Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, Northwest.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Costs**:\n",
    "   - Transportation costs were calculated by multiplying demand for each region by the transportation cost per item for that region.\n",
    "   - Production costs were calculated by multiplying the total demand for each item by the respective variable cost per unit.\n",
    "   - Total costs included fixed costs, transportation costs, and production costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emissions**:\n",
    "   - Transportation emissions were calculated by multiplying demand for each region by the transport emissions per item for that region.\n",
    "   - Production emissions were calculated by multiplying the total demand for each item by its emissions per unit.\n",
    "   - Total emissions included both transportation and production emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assumptions**:\n",
    "   - All demand is met without exceeding facility capacity.\n",
    "   - Costs and emissions scale linearly with demand and distance.\n",
    "   - The selected cities accurately represent the regions geographically and economically.\n",
    "   - The transportation mode (e.g., trucking) is consistent across all locations and distances.\n",

    "Based on the calculated travel times, Denver’s ability to meet the 2-day delivery requirement (48 hours) for all regions is feasible with the use of relay trucking. The estimated travel times for the Northeast (30.9 hours), Southeast (25.5 hours), Midwest (14.5 hours), Southwest (10.9 hours), and Northwest (23.6 hours) are all within the 48-hour window. However, in practice, a single driver cannot sustain continuous driving due to federal Hours of Service (HOS) regulations, which limit drivers to 11 hours of driving per day. To address this, relay trucking can be implemented, where multiple drivers take turns handling the freight at designated relay points. This ensures continuous movement of goods without violating regulations or overburdening individual drivers, making 2-day delivery achievable for even distant regions like the Northeast."

    "The greatest operational bottleneck in the current system appears to be Denver’s inability to meet the required capacity. Whether due to labor constraints, inadequate infrastructure, or a lack of automation, Denver is struggling to keep pace with demand, leading to delays and inefficiencies. This issue is compounded by significant shipping delays, which add to the overall lead time. While shipping times are largely dependent on external logistics partners, they still create a considerable constraint, especially if third-party services cannot scale effectively to meet peak demand. To address these bottlenecks, it would be crucial to increase capacity in Denver through better labor management, automation, and infrastructure improvements. Additionally, optimizing the shipping process by negotiating better terms with logistics partners, improving internal distribution networks, and diversifying shipping routes could help alleviate delays and enhance operational efficiency. Both the capacity limitations in Denver and shipping constraints must be addressed to streamline the entire process and ensure timely delivery."

    "**Process and Assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distances and Representative Cities:**\n",
    "   - We used the following cities as representatives for the regions:\n",
    "     - **Northeast**: New York City (1780 miles from Denver)\n",
    "     - **Southeast**: Miami (2065 miles from Denver)\n",
    "     - **Midwest**: Chicago (1002 miles from Denver)\n",
    "     - **Southwest**: Dallas (794 miles from Denver)\n",
    "     - **Northwest**: Seattle (1320 miles from Denver)\n",
    "   - Distances from the new locations (Charlotte, Columbus, Phoenix) to these regions were used for the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transportation Cost Calculation:**\n",
    "   - The cost per mile was calculated as:\n",
    "     \\\\[\n",
    "     \\\\text{Cost per mile} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Cost from Denver to region}}{\\\\text{Distance from Denver to region}}\n",
    "     \\\\]\n",
    "   - Using the cost per mile, the transportation costs from new locations were calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CO2 Emissions Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Similarly, CO2 emissions per mile were calculated as:\n",
    "     \\\\[\n",
    "     \\\\text{CO2 per mile} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{CO2 emissions from Denver}}{\\\\text{Distance from Denver to region}}\n",
    "     \\\\]\n",
    "   - These values were then multiplied by the distances from the new locations to compute new CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assumptions:**\n",
    "   - We assume the cost per item and CO2 emissions are linear with respect to distance.\n",
    "   - The selected cities accurately represent the regions geographically and economically.\n",
    "   - The transportation mode (e.g., trucking) is consistent across all locations and distances.\n",

    "To avoid exceeding any single facility’s production capacity, we divide the total demand between Denver and each potential new site **(Charlotte, Columbus, or Phoenix)**. For instance, in the “Denver + Charlotte” scenario, Charlotte handles all BSC and CFP demand for the Northeast plus a *portion* of the Southeast, while Denver manages the remaining Southeast along with the Midwest, Southwest, and Northwest. This partial assignment ensures **Charlotte’s** load stays below its 4 million BSC and 3 million CFP annual limits. Similarly, we create splits for “Denver + Columbus” and “Denver + Phoenix,” adjusting which regions (or partial regions) each site serves so that the new facility’s demand also remains within its respective capacities. These predefined, feasible allocations then allow us to calculate the total cost (production + transport + fixed costs) for each **two-facility** network scenario, and compare them to the baseline of “all from Denver.”"

       "### Comprehensive Analysis of 2-Day Delivery Feasibility\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the calculated delivery times, the feasibility of achieving consistent 2-day delivery (within 48 hours) varies significantly across locations and regions. Below is a detailed analysis for each location:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Charlotte**:\n",
       "    - Charlotte performs well for most regions, with delivery times under 17 hours for the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest.\n",
       "    - However, delivery to the Northwest is close to the 48-hour threshold at **46.67 hours**. This leaves almost no margin for unforeseen delays such as traffic, weather, or logistical challenges. Serving the Northwest from Denver instead would improve reliability.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Columbus**:\n",
       "    - Columbus provides excellent delivery times to the Midwest (**6.00 hours**) and competitive times to the Northeast (**8.93 hours**).\n",
       "    - The Northwest is a notable challenge at **40.00 hours**, which is within the 2-day limit but too close for consistent on-time performance. Like Charlotte, this region might be better served from Denver.\n",
       "    - Delivery to the Southeast (**17.17 hours**) and Southwest (**16.67 hours**) is well within feasible limits.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Phoenix**:\n",
       "    - Phoenix struggles with delivery to the Northeast (**40.00 hours**) and Southeast (**39.58 hours**), making these routes highly susceptible to delays. Additionally, the lack of proximity to these regions makes Phoenix less ideal for serving them regularly.\n",
       "    - The Southwest (**17.75 hours**) and Northwest (**23.83 hours**) are well within 2-day delivery feasibility. For the Midwest (**29.17 hours**), Phoenix remains a reasonable option.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Denver**:\n",
       "    - Denver generally provides reliable delivery times across all regions, with its central location offering significant advantages.\n",
       "    - The Northwest is particularly well-served at **22.00 hours**, making Denver the most reliable hub for this region. The Northeast (**29.67 hours**) and Southeast (**34.42 hours**) are within acceptable limits, though not as competitive as other locations.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Observations and Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Northwest Challenges**:\n",
       "    - Both Charlotte and Columbus have delivery times to the Northwest that are too close to the 48-hour limit, making them unreliable for consistent 2-day delivery. Denver should serve as the primary hub for this region.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Northeast and Southeast Delivery**:\n",
       "    - Phoenix struggles significantly with the Northeast and Southeast due to its distance. Alternative hubs such as Charlotte, Columbus, or Denver should handle these regions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Relay Trucking Considerations**:\n",
       "    - While relay trucking (using multiple drivers to ensure non-stop travel) could theoretically mitigate delays, this approach may be cost-prohibitive, especially for routes already nearing the 48-hour mark.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Operational Contingencies**:\n",
       "    - Regions with delivery times exceeding 40 hours should be evaluated for alternative solutions, such as splitting regional coverage between two hubs or leveraging expedited shipping methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, while all locations can theoretically meet the 2-day delivery window, some routes are too close to the threshold to guarantee consistent reliability. Denver's central location makes it the most robust fallback option for regions with tight delivery constraints, particularly the Northwest.\n"

    "\n",
    "Based on the output provided, the combination of **Denver + Columbus** emerges as the best choice for GreenPack’s expansion, considering profitability, speed, and sustainability. Here's how it meets the goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Profitability**:\n",
    "   - **Total Cost**: Denver + Columbus has the **lowest total cost** at $43.42M, which is significantly lower than the other options.\n",
    "  \n",
    "     \n",
    "   - **Cost Savings**: This combination yields the **highest cost savings** of $45.60M compared to operating from Denver alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Speed**:\n",
    "   - Columbus’s **central location** provides efficient access to multiple regions, including the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast, enabling faster deliveries.\n",
    "   - By splitting operations, Denver can continue serving the Southwest and Northwest efficiently, while Columbus reduces the burden for regions farther east.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sustainability**:\n",
    "   - Shorter transportation distances from Columbus to high-demand areas (e.g., Northeast and Southeast) **reduce transportation emissions**, contributing to GreenPack’s sustainability goals.\n",
    "   - Columbus has access to renewable energy initiatives (e.g., Clean Energy Columbus) and fosters green business practices through programs like GreenSpot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Other Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Denver + Charlotte**:\n",
    "   - **Total Cost**: $50.95M, higher than Denver + Columbus.\n",
    "   - While Charlotte is closer to the Southeast and Northeast, its higher fixed costs and environmental regulation complexity make it less cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Denver + Phoenix**:\n",
    "   - **Total Cost**: $93.29M, making it the **most expensive option**.\n",
    "   - Phoenix's distance from high-demand regions (e.g., Northeast and Southeast) results in **higher transportation costs** and emissions, reducing its alignment with profitability and sustainability goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The combination of **Denver + Columbus** is the optimal recommendation for GreenPack, offering the best balance of cost efficiency, delivery speed, and sustainability. It strategically splits operations to minimize transportation costs and emissions while leveraging Columbus’s central location and green initiatives."

    "Our optimized supply chain network carefully balances cost-efficiency, carbon footprint, and regional advantages. By strategically combining Denver with one or more additional facilities, we reduce transportation emissions and operating costs while enhancing alignment with GreenPack's sustainability goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon Footprint: The optimization results show that adding Charlotte or Columbus significantly reduces transportation emissions due to their proximity to high-demand regions like the Southeast and Midwest. For example, allocating Southeast demand to Charlotte reduces emissions by approximately X% compared to serving the region solely from Denver. Conversely, Phoenix contributes higher emissions for East Coast regions but excels in serving Southwest demand with minimal transport emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water Usage: Water scarcity is a key concern in Phoenix, which would require investments in water-efficient technologies or recycled water systems to mitigate environmental impact. Columbus and Charlotte face fewer water-related challenges, making them better suited for water-intensive production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Renewable Energy Adoption: Charlotte and Phoenix stand out for their renewable energy potential. North Carolina’s state green incentives and Arizona’s year-round solar capacity provide opportunities for renewable-powered operations. However, Columbus has limited access to renewables, which could increase the carbon intensity of operations unless investments are made in renewable sourcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waste Reduction: Our optimized network ensures efficient facility utilization, minimizing waste from overproduction or idle capacity. Centralizing operations in Columbus or decentralizing across Denver and Charlotte achieves balanced facility utilization while maintaining flexibility for future growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Community Impact: Charlotte and Phoenix offer strong advantages for local community impact. Charlotte’s skilled workforce and green job potential align with GreenPack’s sustainability goals. Phoenix, with its growing tech sector and university R&D partnerships, fosters innovation in sustainable practices. Columbus, while cost-effective, may require additional investment in workforce training and renewable energy infrastructure to meet GreenPack’s long-term goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regional Trade-offs: Charlotte excels in serving East Coast demand with low transport emissions and access to green incentives but comes with higher labor costs and stricter environmental regulations. Columbus offers a central location with lower costs and strong logistics infrastructure, though its limited renewable options may hinder sustainability progress. Phoenix, while far from East Coast demand, leverages its solar potential and growing tech workforce to support innovative, sustainable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the optimized network demonstrates that adding Charlotte or Columbus to the existing Denver facility offers the best balance of cost, sustainability, and community impact. While Phoenix is less ideal for nationwide demand due to distance, it could serve as a future hub for sustainable innovation in the Southwest. By leveraging regional advantages and addressing challenges such as water scarcity or renewables, GreenPack can build a resilient and sustainable supply chain."
